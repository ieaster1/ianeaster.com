As with most new sites and blogs, this is an initial post to christen a new site.

Making sure things work, everything is put together, that sort of thing.

I can be a wordy fellow at times so I'll keep it short and sweet.  I will be using
this site as a bit of a thought dump, portfolio, show off of sorts.  A place to
drop down ideas or process how I'm working through projects or self learning.

I'd like to consider this place as my contribution to the team.  Hopefully something
is helpful to someone one day.  Even if that person is me.
