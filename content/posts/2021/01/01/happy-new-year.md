A very welcomed Happy New Year to you all and welcome to my personal site.

I'll consider this place as a showcase, note collection, and possibly a source of information.

My primary focus is around Linux, Python, containers and several automation tools.  However,
I dip into many areas and categories so stick around to see if anything catches your fancy.
